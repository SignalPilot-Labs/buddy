# AutoFyn

Autonomous AI software engineer. Runs as a Docker stack: agent container (Claude Code SDK), dashboard (FastAPI + Next.js), PostgreSQL, sandbox (gVisor). Supports remote sandboxes on HPC clusters and GPU servers via SSH tunnel.

## How It Works

Three containers: `autofyn/` is the brain (orchestrator, decisions, DB), `sandbox/` is the hands (executes all code, git, Claude SDK), `dashboard/` is the control plane (starts/stops runs, settings, SSE streaming). Agent never runs untrusted code — everything goes through HTTP to sandbox.

Sandboxes can be **local Docker** (default) or **remote** (Docker/Slurm on any SSH-reachable machine). Remote sandboxes are managed by the **connector** (`cli/cli/connector/`), a local process that opens SSH tunnels, proxies traffic, and manages lifecycle. The agent talks to both local and remote sandboxes through the same HTTP API — `autofyn/sandbox_client/backends/` abstracts the difference.

The orchestrator delegates to subagents organized by phase: Explore (code-explorer, debugger), Plan (architect), Build (backend-dev, frontend-dev), Review (code-reviewer, ui-reviewer, security-reviewer). Subagents write their reports to `/tmp/round-N/<agent-name>.md`.

## Package Layout

- `autofyn/` — Agent (brain): orchestrator loop, lifecycle, memory, session, subagent prompts
- `autofyn/sandbox_client/` — HTTP client to sandbox: repo ops, session management, file I/O
- `autofyn/sandbox_client/backends/` — Sandbox backend abstraction: `docker_local_backend.py` (local), `remote_backend.py` (remote via connector)
- `sandbox/` — Sandbox (hands): HTTP API, Claude SDK sessions, SecurityGate
- `sandbox/api/` — HTTP endpoints: env, file_system, repo, session, health
- `sandbox/repo/` — Git/GitHub operations: clone, commit, push, PR, diff
- `sandbox/sdk/` — Claude SDK session lifecycle, security gating, event streaming
- `dashboard/backend/` — FastAPI dashboard API: runs, settings, SSE streaming, agent proxy, remote sandbox CRUD
- `dashboard/frontend/` — Next.js UI: run feed, controls, settings, diff viewer
- `db/` — Shared SQLAlchemy models and connection (PostgreSQL)
- `cli/` — CLI tool: `autofyn start/stop/run/settings` via dashboard API
- `cli/cli/connector/` — Remote sandbox connector: SSH tunnels, reverse proxy, startup/shutdown lifecycle
- `config/` — Shared config loader and constants (sandbox config, AF_BOUND/AF_READY markers)

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12, FastAPI, aiohttp, SQLAlchemy (async), Claude Agent SDK
- Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- PostgreSQL, Docker Compose, gVisor

## Build & Install — IMPORTANT

**This is a monorepo. The root has no installable package** — it's a `pyproject.toml` for pytest config only (no `[build-system]`, no `[project]`). Do NOT run `pip install -e .` at the repo root.

The actual Python packages live in subdirectories, each with their own `pyproject.toml`:

- `autofyn/pyproject.toml` — agent orchestrator (installed in `autofyn-agent` container)
- `sandbox/pyproject.toml` — sandbox HTTP server (installed in `autofyn-sandbox` container)
- `cli/pyproject.toml` — `autofyn` CLI (installed on the host by `install.sh`)
- `dashboard/backend/pyproject.toml` — dashboard FastAPI backend (installed in `autofyn-dashboard` container)
- `db/pyproject.toml` — shared SQLAlchemy models (installed in all three containers)

**To set up a dev environment (for pyright/pytest to resolve imports like `fastapi`, `aiohttp`, etc.):** install each subdir individually with its dev extras:

```
pip install -e "./db[dev]"
pip install -e "./autofyn[dev]"
pip install -e "./sandbox[dev]"
pip install -e "./dashboard/backend[dev]"
pip install -e "./cli[dev]"
```

Skip any subdir that doesn't have `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` — just use `pip install -e ./<subdir>`.

**If you see `Import "fastapi" could not be resolved` or similar, deps are not installed** — run the installs above before running pyright/pytest.

Day-to-day development runs everything via `docker compose up -d` (or `autofyn start`). To rebuild a container after a code change: `docker compose build <service> && docker compose up -d --force-recreate <service>`.

# Code Rules

These rules are mandatory. All AI agents must follow them. No exceptions.

## Imports

- All imports at the top of the file. No inline imports inside functions or methods.
- Absolute imports from the package root. No relative imports (`from . import`). No `sys.path` hacks.
- `__init__.py` files must be empty. No code, no re-exports, no `__all__`.

## Constants

- All magic values (numbers, strings, URLs, ports, timeouts, limits) go in a dedicated `constants.py`, `models.py` or `sh` file.
- No magic values inline in code. No default values for function parameters — pass constants explicitly at the call site.

## Types

- Every function must have full type annotations (parameters and return type).
- Run `pyright` before considering work done. It must pass at `standard` level (configured in `pyrightconfig.json`).

## No Defensive Coding

- No `hasattr()`, `isinstance()` checks for duck typing, `getattr()` with defaults, or `try/except` for control flow.
- Trust your types. If the type system says it's there, it's there. If it might not be, fix the type.

## Fail Fast

- Never mask a failure with a fallback. If a required value is missing, raise/reject — do not substitute a default and keep going.
- No layered `value ?? fallback1 ?? fallback2 ?? default` chains that hide which layer is broken. One source of truth, one failure surface.
- Dead fallback parameters lie about the contract. If a parameter is only used when the real source is null, drop it.
- Silent error swallowing (empty `catch`, `try/except: pass`, fallback to stale state) is worse than a crash. Surface the error and let the caller decide.
- Distinct failure modes must render/report distinctly. `$0.00` shown for "no data yet", "really zero", and "pipeline broken" hides bugs; render `—` for missing and `$0.00` only when confirmed.

## Architecture

- OOP with clear separation of concerns. One class, one responsibility. One function, one task.
- Orchestrator/executor pattern: orchestrators delegate, executors do work. No god classes.
- Dependency injection: pass dependencies in, don't import and instantiate internally.
- DRY: if logic appears twice, extract it. Common code in base classes or shared helpers.

## Size Limits

- No function longer than 50 lines except in critical cases. Extract helpers.
- No file longer than 500 lines. Split into focused modules.

## Tests

- One test class per file. Test files share fixtures, mocks, and conftest helpers — but each class lives in its own file.
- Every bug fix must include a regression test that would have caught the bug. No exceptions.
- If a test modifies the testing environment (`os.environ`, `sys.modules`, global state), it MUST revert to the original state in teardown. No exceptions. Use `setup_method`/`teardown_method` to capture and restore, or `monkeypatch` which auto-reverts. Never use `setdefault` with a value different from the test env — it causes order-dependent failures.

## Verification

Before finishing any task, run:
```
pyright
ruff check
python -m pytest tests/fast/ -q
```
All three must pass clean. `AF_IMAGE_TAG` defaults to `test` via `tests/fast/conftest.py`.

## Audit Event Types

- The canonical list of audit event types lives in `db/constants.py` → `AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES`.
- When adding or removing an event type, you MUST update ALL THREE locations:
  1. `db/constants.py` — `AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES` (source of truth)
  2. `dashboard/frontend/lib/types.ts` — `AuditEventType` union + `AUDIT_EVENT_META`
  3. `dashboard/frontend/lib/groupEventHelpers.ts` — `milestoneFromAudit()` switch case (if the event should be rendered)
- Cross-language sync tests enforce this: `tests/fast/test_audit_event_sync.py` and `dashboard/frontend/__tests__/audit-event-sync.test.ts`. They will fail if the sets diverge.

## Starter Presets

- Canonical keys: `db/constants.py` → `STARTER_PRESET_KEYS`. Adding/removing requires updating: `db/constants.py`, `autofyn/prompts/starter/<key>.md`, `dashboard/frontend/lib/constants.ts`. Sync tests enforce parity.

## Pull Requests

- **Always open PRs against `main`.** The repo default branch is `production`, but that is the release branch — day-to-day work merges into `main`. Pass `--base main` explicitly to `gh pr create` (or edit the base after creation) so PRs don't land on `production` by accident.
