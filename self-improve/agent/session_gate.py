"""Session gate: the end_session MCP tool and time-lock logic.

The agent has exactly ONE way to end a run: calling the `end_session` tool.
This tool is time-locked — it will be denied until the run duration expires.
The operator can also unlock it early via a control signal.

When denied, the tool returns a message telling the agent how much time
remains and suggests what to work on next (escalating depth).
