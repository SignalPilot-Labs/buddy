# Code Quality Standards

## Error Handling
- Never use bare `except:` — always catch specific exceptions
- Log errors with context before re-raising
- At API boundaries: return structured error responses, never raw exception strings
- Internal functions: let exceptions propagate unless you can handle them meaningfully

## Input Validation
- Validate at system boundaries (API endpoints, user input, external data)
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Don't validate internal function calls — trust the type system

## Python Patterns
- Type hints on all public function signatures
- Docstrings on public functions (one-liner is fine for simple functions)
- Use `pathlib.Path` over string concatenation for file paths
- Use `asyncio` consistently — don't mix sync and async database calls

## TypeScript Patterns
- Strict mode enabled
- Explicit return types on exported functions
- Use `unknown` over `any` where possible
- Proper null checks with optional chaining

## What NOT to Fix
- Import ordering — leave it alone
- String quote style — leave it alone
- Trailing whitespace — leave it alone
- Variable naming in working code — leave it alone
- Adding comments to self-explanatory code
